	- Also, you can drop any files/folders into the various editor frames and text boxes to get their paths added directly.

- `Exe.FindSpace` function has been changed to `Exe.Allocate` and it always reserves the space allocated now. 

- Continuing from the above change, `Exe.Add*` functions no longer takes the target address as an argument. Please use the `Exe.Set*` functions instead on `allocated` addresses.

- If the value going to be added is already known, then use the `Exe.Add*` functions to stage the addition to the `DIFF` section and use it's return value (addresses & size - similar to `Exe.Allocate`). 

- `Exe.ProtectChanges` function has been split into `Exe.ConcealChanges` and `Exe.RevealChanges` respectively and they both take a password now.

- Added caching support to `Exe.FindFunc` to avoid repetitive searches for the same function later.

	| ----------------   | ----------- |
	| `<map>.open`       | Provides a proxy for destructuring the keys out similar to an `Object` |
	| `<map>.hasValue`   | Check if the map has the specified value (alternative to the `has` function |
	| `<set>.get`        | Retrieve a value using it's index |
	| `<func>.call_self` | Enables call a function with itself as the `this` pointer |

## Patch/Extension Updates
- Started using all the new features in all the patches & extensions.

## Tool Updates
- Added 2 new options related to errors in [Test Bench].

	- `Show only errors & warnings` => As the name sounds, it allows for skipping 'success' & 'ignored' messages for each individual patch/extension during tests.
	
	- `Show lines with error` => Option to display the linenumber & filename from where the error originated.

- Modified the way the exe file names are displayed during test => Now the test directory being used is displayed first and only the filenames are reported seperately.


# 2021-08-22 Changes

## Script Updates
- Added `PatchReporter` function which uses the logging mechanism to report the changes staged by the tool. 

- Moved most of the `Init` scripts into Modules.

- Added a new `CACHE` module for storing data persistent per session i.e. It will remain in there as long as you don't load a new client.
  
  The module also helps with setting up shared data & changes amongst related patches by means of multiple Vaults & a User Registration system.

## Tool Updates
- Added `Exe.HasTag` function to check for existing tags.

- Enabled the use of `this` pointer in all the patch & extension functions. It will point to the main function for each.

- Modified the change reporting mechanism to use a Scripted function called `PatchReporter` instead.

- Now evaluation errors displays the line number & filename the error came from properly.


# 2021-08-20 Changes

## Script Updates
- Shifted `Log` and `OpCodeList` to module files

- Added depth settings to `Log` for hiding unnecessary level of support function logs. All the support functions have been updated.

- Added `getReg` functon to `ModRM` and `SIBase` classes to get their respective member registers quickly.

  It accepts 1 letter as argument ('R' & 'O' for `ModRm` , `I` & `B` for `SIBase`)

- Added `PH_Regs` map to get Placeholder registers quickly based on bit sizes.

- Removed `TAB` constant since it is not needed anymore.

- Shifted some of the content in initialization scripts into modules.


# 2021-08-19 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Changed the root node of **`Patches.yml` & `Extensions.yml`** to a map. No more hyphens needed for Group names and Extension names.

- Added support for including/importing additional YAML files into current one for **`Style` & `Language`** files as well as **`Patches.yml`** by means of the **`include`** key.

  It can be either 1 name of list of names. 
  
  **`Extensions.yml` do not have it yet since it will rarely get big enough to split into multiple files.**

- Session files now also records the selected **`extensions`**, the **`Test Dir`** as well as the selected **`tester exes`** when saving the file in [Test Bench].

  This will help to quickly start the tests when re-launched, instead of selecting everything again from scratch.

- Updated the inbuilt extension for converting NEMO profiles to WARP session files. Inputs are also mapped properly now (aside from **`D_MultiChoice`**).

- Fixed issue with session file generation of **`Target Exe`** when the option is enabled.

- Added support for fully encrypted scripts with the suffix **`.ejs`**. It can also have an optional disclaimer/license header.

  **Do not try to create this manually.**
  
- Added **`Warp.EncryptFile`** function for generating **`.ejs`** files from the specified source file. Any disclaimer/license header present will be retained as is.

- Added **`Warp.LoadEJS`** function for loading **`.ejs`** files explicitly from scripts or the **`Script Editor`**.

- Added support for module scripts with the suffix **`.mjs`**.

	- Modules are a handy way of encapsulating 'Singleton' objects and as such you are likely to see more use of these in future.

	- The name of the module can be defined inside the **`.mjs`** file by adding the following in a seperate line:

	   `// MODULE_NAME => put_the_name_here`

	- In case this line is not there, then the tool will use the **basename** of the file as the module name.

	- Be aware that modules only get loaded once and the variables exported can only be updated from within the module.

	- Since the loading process is different, module scripts cannot be encrypted into **`.ejs`**.


# 2021-08-18 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added overload of **`Exe.FindHexN`, `Exe.FindLastHexN`, `Exe.FindTextN` & `Exe.FindLastTextN`** functions to accept a `min`, `max` pair as the count.

  These will return an empty list if the number of elements are < `min` or > `max`.

- Fixed bugs and modified the inner workings of **`D_Color`** type. It only takes the following constraints now:

	- `format` => Previously called `order`. Indicates the format in which the components need to be kept from MSB to LSB.

	- `R`, `G`, `B` & `A` => Optional keys to set the default value for any missing components in the format (need this for the color `ColorPanel` being displayed).
	
- Similarly the color value can be provided in one of 3 forms:

	- `[component list]` => The components need to follow the `format` specified. i.e. for `RGB`, it should be [r,g,b]

	- `0xnumber` => Same point here the bytes need to follow the `format` specified from MSB to LSB

	- `'#hexcode'` => Standard coloring hex code . The `format` is only used for determining the internal byte representation.

- Changed `align` constraint to `pad` for string types. 

- `align` constraint now represents the horizontal alignment of the string values inside the respective textboxes of the **`Input Dialog`**


# 2021-08-17 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Fixed the visual bug with List Panel (used for **`D_Choice & D_MultiChoice`** types) where the frame was coming out and the window just kept enlarging too much.

- Disabled the corner size-grips from going beyond specified `maxWidth` & `maxHeight` if any.

- Added a **"Global"** patch that is now available by default when an exe is loaded.

	- The purpose of this patch is to allow for a common patch to stage changes shared by multiple patches.

  	- Therefore it will not be available for selection in the **`Patch List`**.

- Added **`Exe.ActivateGlobal` & `Exe.ClearGlobal`** functions to work with the aforementioned **"Global"** patch (as counterparts to **SetActivePatch** & **ClearPatch**.

  These also selects & deselects the **"Global"** patch respectively unlike their counterparts.

- Added **`ActivePatch`** property to **`Exe`** object which reflects the name of the currently active patch.

  You can also set it directly instead of using **SetActivePatch** function.

- **`Exe.ClearPatch` & `Exe.SetActivePatch`** can now be invoked without arguments. Behavior for empty argument is as follows:

	- **`Exe.ClearPatch`** => will clear the changes in the active patch.
	
	- **`Exe.SetActivePatch`** => will keep no patch as active. Same thing happens if you assign **`Exe.ActivePatch`** member directly.

- Added **`Exe.UndoChanges`** function to revert the changes setup for a range of addresses.

- Added **`Exe.FreeUp`** function to revert the changes setup & free up a range of addresses from `DIFF` section.

- Added **`Exe.BeginTag` , `Exe.EndTag` , `Exe.DelTag`** for associating tag names with set of changes & address reservations (in `DIFF` section) to tag names.

	- The first 2 are used to mark the beginning & ending of the tagging process.

	- If **`Exe.BeginTag`** is again invoked with the same name, the previous changes gets wiped (and you can optionally `FreeUp` any reservations too).

	- The 3rd one is for deleting a tag. With this you have the option of either preserving or discarding the staged changes & reservations respectively.


# 2021-08-16 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added overloads for **`Warp.Define` , `Warp.Encrypt` & `Warp.Execute`** functions to accept list of strings (which gets concatenated internally).

- Added support for links in titles, tooltips & descriptions of **`Patch List & Extension List`** (latter only makes sense while testing though).

- A `linkText` key is now available for specifying color for these link texts (items in the lists) inside a **`Style file`**

- Right clicking on the items in **`Patch List, Extension List & Exe List`** will now copy the details to the clipboard.

- All **`patch`** functions & sub-functions as well as **`extension`** functions get their respective titles as optional 2nd argument now.

- Added **`allowSkip`** key for use in **`Patches.yml` & `Extensions.yml`** to allow skipping of patches & extensions respectively without reporting it as a warning.

  The **`SkippedPatches.log`** file will still have the details.

- Fixed the issue where patches & extensions could not be fully empty.

  Now you can just specify the `<name>` alone without any keys attached to use the defaults for the other details.

- Fixed the issue with `Ctrl+Q` interruption mechanism.

- Fixed the issue with empty string auto-returning false for all the string types in **`Exe.GetUserInput`**

- Modified the usage of **`D_Hex`** type. Now it only has 2 constraints to guide it

	- **`endian`** => Indicates the endianness of the displayed values. This can be either `little` or `big` . Default is `big` .
	
	- **`byteCount`** => The number of bytes expected to be stored. Default is 1

- Added optional `stepSize0`, `stepSize1`, `stepSize2` & `stepSize3` constraints to use for the respective individual elements of **`D_Vec\*`** types.

- Enabled global `min`, `max` and `stepSize` constraints to **`D_Vec\*`** as well.

  If the individual constraint is not available, the elements will pick up these.

- The escape characters `\n` and `\t` now gets displayed properly in the **`Output`** section. Same goes for blank spaces.

- Added `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` constraints in the **`Input Dialog`** for all types.

- Added **`Warp.clearEditor` & `Warp.clearOutput`** functions for clearing the **`Script Editor` & `Output`** sections respectively from Scripts or the editor itself.

  **Please note that the starting letter is small unlike other functions** (need this way, since these serve as signals)


# 2021-08-15 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added option in the **`Settings`** dialog to show the modifications setup via **`Exe.Set\*` & `Exe.Add\*`** functions.

- Added **`Exe.ProtectChanges`** function to selectively avoid the above switch when needed. It gets automatically re-enabled when the patch/extension function call is over. 

- Added **`Exe.SetFloat` & `Exe.GetFloat`** functions. Also added **`Exe.SetBytes`** function for list of bytes.

- Added **`Exe.Add\*`** variants of all the numeric types (including float) as well as list of bytes.


# 2021-07-31 Changes

- Fixed the [byte order issue in Packet Key patches](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/issues/55). 

  The `PACKET` object now better recognizes patched clients and `Get Packet Keys` extension works correctly for patched clients too.


# 2021-07-25 Changes

## Patch Updates
- Rearranging some codes and using `const` where appropriate.

## Tool Updates
- Added `findAs` function to `Array` types as an extended version of `find`. The function provided as argument can return the result required instead of `true`.

# 2021-07-22 Changes

## Patch Updates
- Converted a lot of `let` to `const`

- Changed some of the `forEach` functions to `for of` loops.

## Tool Updates
- Changed the placeholder functions to use `_` & `_.` instead of `?` to avoid clashing with regular wildcards.

- Removed `SwapFiller` & `SetFillTarget` function (kind of redundant with the other one without much benefits).

- Changed the way the byte count is sent to `SwapFillers` and `SetFillTargets`, now the byte count can be clubbed with the index as a string key => `"index, bc"`

- Also, for `SetFillTargets`, the starting address needs to be provided in the map argument itself using the key `start`. If it's not there then `0` is assumed.

- Converted a lot of `let` to `const`

- Changed some of the `forEach` functions to `for of` loops.

- Changed `LOCK`, `REPE` & `REPN` to `ILOCK`, `IREPE` & `IREPN` respectively. The first 3 are now functions instead to automatically prefix these values.

  `REP` function has also been provided as an alias to `REPE`. Check the wiki for more details. 

- Added string instructions to use with the `REP*` functions.

- Updated **'Init'** scripts to reflect the changes in placeholder functions.

# 2021-07-06 Changes

## Tool Updates
- Added [Exe.ClearSavedInput](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#patch-related) for clearing existing inputs. Useful in Test Bench.

- Fixed the bug with WARP crashing when running **`Exe.GetUserInput`** from [Script Window](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Script-Window).

	- **`FP_STOP`**  = Frame pointer ends (`mov esp, ebp` followed by `pop ebp`)
	
	- **`POP_EAX`**  = Obvious no?
	
	- **`CDQ`**
	
	- **`INT3`**

- Changed [Exe.IsSelected](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#patch-related) function to [Warp.GetPatchState](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Warp-Object#functions) for logical reasons.

- Changed [Exe.TestMode](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Exe-Object#properties) to [Warp.TestMode](https://github.com/Neo-Mind/WARP/wiki/Warp-Object#properties) as well.

- Added 2 functions for displaying messages from patch/extension scripts.
