^000088Episode: The Kingdom of Rune-Midgard ^000000

The sacred ^880000Empire of Rune-Midgard^000000 has reigned over a vast territory near the center of the Midgard continent for over a thousand years and is currently ruled by the wise and benevolent King Tristram III. Although various religions are practiced in Rune-Midgard, Odin is the nation’s primary deity. The Prontera Sanctuary is dedicated to the worship of Odin and is located in the capital of Rune-Midgard, Prontera.

Prontera's advantageous position at the center of the Midgard continent is the secret to the nation’s thriving trade and prosperity. The capital is also renowned as a city where Swordsmen can choose to pursue their careers as Knights or Crusaders. The Swordsman Association was also situated in Prontera but later moved its headquarters to Izlude, a satellite city of Prontera.

Geffen, the city of magic, is located in the northeast of the kingdom of Rune-Midgard. The city attracts many aspiring Mages, and the Geffen Tower is considered sacred ground for magic practitioners, as well as a symbol of Geffen. Rumors suggest that the secret to finding Gefenia, an ancient mystical city where the elves hid their treasures, lies in Geffen.

Morroc is a small desert town located southwest of the kingdom of Rune-Midgard. Most people keep their distance from Morroc’s arid heat, but the town attracts many aspiring Thieves since it is home to the Thieves’ Guild. There are rumors that the Mercenary Guild hides somewhere in the Sograt Desert near Morroc, leading many aspiring Mercenaries to explore the desert.

Payon is a village in the northeastern mountains of the kingdom of Rune-Midgard. Masters of archery and hunting have long practiced their crafts in Payon, making the village famous for its Archers and its training of exceptional Hunters. It is believed that Payon’s Archers never miss their targets. The "Gakkung," a powerful composite bow, is a specialty product of Payon’s archery trade.

Alberta is a maritime trade city located in the southeast of the kingdom of Rune-Midgard. Although ships traveling between Izlude and Alberta are frequent targets of pirates, the land route to Alberta is much longer and difficult to traverse. Alberta thrives thanks to its cheerful atmosphere and its tax-free trade policy. Despite the pirate threat, the Merchant Guild controls one-third of all trade rights across the continent.

Al De Baran, a calm and civilized city, is known for the mysterious Clock Tower that adorns its central plaza. The craftsmen of Al De Baran have produced countless handmade clocks since the city’s founding and dispose of broken or defective ones in the ancient tower. Somehow, the tower’s magical energies transformed all the clocks within it into living creatures with sinister intelligence. Eventually, these monsters drove all humans out of the tower, turning it into a frightening place dominated by clock creatures and their creations. Many curious adventurers have explored the Clock Tower and attempted to eliminate the malevolent creatures there, but few ever return alive. Indeed, to this day, the true mysteries of Al De Baran’s Clock Tower remain a secret.
