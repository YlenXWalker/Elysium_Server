# Aura Database
###########################################################################
#
# - AuraID                  Aura Number
# EffectList: Required field, this is the list of special effects for the aura.
#     - EffectID            Required field, special effect number
# ReplayInterval Optional node, the replay interval for non-persistent effects (unit: milliseconds)
#
###########################################################################
#
# - AuraID
# Halo number, the default halo number preset by Panda starts from 1000.
# The numbers do not need to be consecutive. If you want to add your own halo combinations, it is recommended to start numbering directly from 2000.
#
#If multiple configurations with the same aura number appear in this database's configuration files,
#So ultimately, only the configuration with the highest priority will prevail, with the priorities in the following order:
#
# - 1. db/import/aura_db.yml (High priority)
# - 2. db/aura_db.yml (low priority)
#
#If the same halo number appears in the same file, the configuration closer to the end of the file will take precedence.
#
###########################################################################
#
# EffectList:
# Required nodes, list, sub-nodes belonging to AuraID
# This node lists the effects that will appear when this aura is activated; there can be multiple.
#
###########################################################################
# 
#     - EffectID
# Required node, value must be of numeric type, member of the EffectList.
# Special effect number, you can fill in one or more, but at least one must be filled in.
# The special effect numbers here can refer to the list of effects in doc/effect_list.txt.
#
###########################################################################
# 
# ReplayInterval
# Optional nodes, with values of numeric type, are sub-nodes of EffectID.
# Non-durable effect replay interval (unit: milliseconds), durable effects do not need to be set or can be set to 0.

#
# How to Choose Long-lasting Special Effects
#
#By default, this database has pre-configured dozens of halo combinations, but they are all quite ordinary.
#If you want to choose special effects yourself, you can use the @effect command in the game to select them.
#
# The specific approach is:
# 1. Try using @effect with the effects in doc/effect_list.txt.
# 2. Is the observed effect persistent, or will it disappear on its own?
# 3. If the effect persists before transitioning between scenes and during minor exits, then it indicates that it is suitable as a lasting effect for the aura.
# 4. For persistent effects, please do not set the ReplayInterval, otherwise the aura will continue to stack until the client crashes.
# 
###########################################################################
#
# Selection Method for Non-Persistent Effects
# 
#Some special effects look very beautiful but disappear automatically after a few seconds; these short-lived effects are called non-persistent effects.
#You can use ReplayInterval to play a brief effect on the server every few seconds.
# 
# The specific approach is:
# 1. Try using @effect with the effects in doc/effect_list.txt.
# 2. Is the observed effect persistent, or does it disappear on its own? If it disappears, pay attention to its approximate duration.
# 3. When setting the special effects to the aura, also set the ReplayInterval for it (you can refer to the preset 1064 aura).
# 4. If you are very concerned about the transition of special effects, then please test the playback duration of the effects multiple times and set the intervals correctly.
#
###########################################################################
#
# Prompt:
# Self-added aura combinations, please define them in the db/import/aura_db.yml file.
#This way, if there are updates on the server in the future, there will be no need to repeat the process of merging differences.
